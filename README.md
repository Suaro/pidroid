Pidroid is android library to perform fast face detection, pupil detection and landmarks detection without third-party dependencies dependencies.

### Motivation

This library has been developed to facilitate the integration of a face detection method in your Android application.

Usually, to install a face detection library, some integration with third-party software such as OpenCV or Tensorflow Lite or registration on a platform such as Firebase is necessary.

On the other hand, the weight of face detection models is usually high, which causes the application to grow unnecessarily.

Pidroid provides a completely dependency-free alternative to make it easier for developers to use these libraries.

### Built With

This library currently is full developed in Kotlin with C++, no additional dependencies or installation is needed :) 

- Face detection feature is based on ***Pixel Intensity Comparison-based Object detection*** paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.4537.pdf)
- Pupil detection feature is based on [Eye pupil localization with an ensemble of randomized trees](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320313003294)
- Landmarks detection feature is based on [Fast Localization of Facial Landmark Points](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6888.pdf)
